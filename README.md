## Fragmenting Code into Custom Hooks

When developing applications, it's often beneficial to fragment code into custom hooks to enhance code organization, reusability, maintainability, and testability. Here's why:

### 1. Code Reusability
Fragmenting code into custom hooks promotes reusability across different components. Each custom hook encapsulates a specific piece of functionality, such as token burning or fetching token supply statistics, making it easy to reuse that functionality in multiple components without duplicating code.

### 2. Modularization
Custom hooks serve as standalone modules that handle specific tasks or functionalities. This modular approach enhances the manageability of the codebase, as each hook focuses on a single responsibility. For example, the useTokenSupplyStats hook deals with fetching and managing token supply statistics, keeping this concern separate from other parts of the application logic.

### 3. Simplified Component Logic
Abstracting complex logic into custom hooks simplifies the responsibilities of components. Components can then focus on rendering UI elements and managing local state, while custom hooks handle the underlying logic. This separation of concerns improves code readability, maintainability, and extendability.

### 4. Testing
Custom hooks can be tested independently, making it easier to test application logic. Because each hook encapsulates a specific functionality, it's simpler to write focused unit tests without needing to consider the broader context of the application. This approach enhances the reliability and stability of the codebase.

In summary, fragmenting code into custom hooks promotes better organization, reusability, maintainability, and testability of the codebase, leading to a more robust and scalable application architecture.
